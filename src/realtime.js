// Real-time live-view relay: a single Durable Object instance that gates a

// point is that the live view has no memory beyond "is a browser watching
// right now". See CLAUDE.md's read-path philosophy: this is deliberately the
// opposite of it (push, not pull; ephemeral, not durable), so it lives
// alongside the D1 pipeline rather than inside it.
